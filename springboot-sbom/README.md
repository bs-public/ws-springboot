# springboot-sbom

SBOM stands for "Software Bill of Materials" and describes the components used to build a software artifact. These SBOMs are useful because they describe exactly what your application contains. With that information, you can assess if a security vulnerability affects your application, or use automated security tools to scan your applications and alert you on security vulnerabilities.
